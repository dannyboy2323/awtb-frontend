# Postcard Overlay Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Story Route (`app/stories/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- Added support for `story-0001` slug in the `getStoryContent` function
- Added `story-0001` to the `generateStaticParams` function to enable static generation
- The story page will now render properly when navigating to `/stories/story-0001`

### 2. Updated Home Page (`app/page.tsx`)
- Added a centered postcard overlay that appears over the entire page
- The overlay is positioned using `fixed inset-0 flex items-center justify-center` for perfect centering
- Added hover effects with scale transform and shadow transitions
- The postcard links to `/stories/story-0001` when clicked
- Used Next.js `Image` component for optimized image loading
- The overlay has `z-50` to ensure it appears above other content

### 3. Created Image Placeholder
- Created `public/assets/postcard-hola-cuba.jpg` as a placeholder image
- **Note**: This is currently a placeholder image. You need to replace it with the actual postcard image from your message.

## Image Replacement Instructions

To replace the placeholder with the actual postcard image:

1. Save the postcard image from your message as `public/assets/postcard-hola-cuba.jpg`
2. The image should be approximately 600x400 pixels for optimal display
3. Ensure the file format is JPG as referenced in the code

## Features Implemented

- **Centered Overlay**: The postcard is perfectly centered both horizontally and vertically
- **Clickable Link**: Clicking the postcard navigates to `/stories/story-0001`
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth scale and shadow transitions on hover
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Optimized**: Uses Next.js Image component for performance

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. You should see the postcard overlay in the center of the page
4. Click the postcard to navigate to the story-0001 page
5. The story page should display "Story #0001" as the title

## Next Steps

1. Replace the placeholder image with the actual postcard image
2. Add content to the story-0001 page by updating the `getStoryContent` function
3. Test the functionality in different browsers and screen sizes
