The protagonist had been walking for hours, guided only by an old map and an inexplicable pull toward something unknown. The trees seemed to lean inward, creating a natural cathedral of branches overhead.

  The map said there would be a clearing here... but all I see are more trees.

As twilight painted the sky in shades of amber and crimson, Elena finally stumbled into a circular clearing. At its center stood a massive stone covered in symbols that seemed to glow with their own inner light.

  This... this wasn't on the map. What is this place?
</Dialogue>

The symbols pulsed brighter as she approached, and suddenly the air filled with a low, melodic humming. From the shadows stepped a figure cloaked in starlight.

<Dialogue speaker="The Guide" mood="shout" position="right">
  Welcome, seeker. You have found the place where all adventures begin.
